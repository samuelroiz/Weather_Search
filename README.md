### Latitude vs Temperature
![Latitude vs Temperature](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/Latitude_Vs_Temperature.png)

The following image is the latitude versus temperature and how it curves into a negative quadratic equation. We see that the higher the latitude reaches, the coldness rises. Latitude above zero is known as the northern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere is colder than the southern hemisphere. 

### Latitude vs Humidity

The following image portrays latitude versus humidity. It shows there is no correlation between latitude and humidity. If the gridline was high, the mugginess was found in the lows or the highs. 


### Latitude vs Cloudiness

The following image portrays latitude versus cloudiness similarly to latitude versus humidity. It shows there is no correlation between the two variables. If the latitude or cloudiness was high, the variables are randomly found in the lows or the highs. 

### Latitude vs Wind Speed
![Latitude vs Wind Speed](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/Latitude_Vs_Wind_Speed.png)

The following image portrays latitude versus wind speed. The wind speed is marked in the low zeros to two point five range. The image is not similar to the previous charts. The two variables show the correlation between latitude and wind speed. When the breeze is stronger than average, latitude is located anywhere besides zero. The zero mark shows it will have low wind rates.
