## About the Project
This project involves creating a Python script using Jupyter Notebook to analyze the financial records of a company. The analysis will determine the company's financial health, indicating whether it is profitable and identifying which months are most favorable for the company.

The above image shows the outcome of the company's financial data analysis. The script calculates the company's profit and the average monthly profit. It also identifies the months with minimum and maximum profits or losses to determine which months are most and least favorable for the company.
