### Two Variables comparison

#### Latitude vs Temperature
![Latitude vs Temperature](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/Latitude_Vs_Temperature.png)

The following image is the latitude versus temperature and how it curves into a negative quadratic equation. We see that the higher the latitude reaches, the coldness rises. Latitude above zero is known as the northern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere is colder than the southern hemisphere. 

#### Latitude vs Humidity
![Latitude vs Humidity](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/Latitude_Vs_Humidity.png)

The following image portrays latitude versus humidity. It shows there is no correlation between latitude and humidity. If the gridline was high, the mugginess was found in the lows or the highs. 


#### Latitude vs Cloudiness

The following image portrays latitude versus cloudiness similarly to latitude versus humidity. It shows there is no correlation between the two variables. If the latitude or cloudiness was high, the variables are randomly found in the lows or the highs. 

#### Latitude vs Wind Speed
![Latitude vs Wind Speed](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/Latitude_Vs_Wind_Speed.png)

The following image portrays latitude versus wind speed. The wind speed is marked in the low zeros to two point five range. The image is not similar to the previous charts. The two variables show the correlation between latitude and wind speed. When the breeze is stronger than average, latitude is located anywhere besides zero. The zero mark shows it will have low wind rates. 

### Northern Hemisphere

#### N. Latitude vs Temperature
![Nothern Latitude vs Temperature](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/North_Latitude_Vs_Temperature.png)

The following image displays the northern latitude versus temperature with a red line across its data points. The red line represents the regression and predicts information placements if other information was added. This image almost has the same exact points with latitude versus temperature chart. We stated in the previous image latitude above zero is known as the northern hemisphere and the curve curves into a negative quadratic equation. The regression does not have a quadratic equation but it is negative. We also see that the higher the latitude reaches, the coldness rises. The northern hemisphere is colder than the southern hemisphere.

#### N. Latitude vs Humidity
![Nothern Latitude vs Humidity](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/North_Latitude_Vs_Humidity.png)

The following image displays the northern latitude versus humidity with a red line across its data points. The red line represents the regression and predicts information placements if other information was added. Unlike the previous chart, the regression equation is positive. 

#### N. Latitude vs Cloudiness
![Nothern Latitude vs Cloudiness](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/North_Latitude_Vs_Cloudiness.png)

The following image displays the northern latitude versus cloudiness with a red line across its data points. The red line represents the regression and predicts information placements if other information was added. The regression is positive and its data is all over the place. In the northern hemisphere, cloudiness does not play a factor when it depends on the latitude. 

### Southern Hemisphere

#### S. Latitude vs Temperature
![Southern Latitude vs Temperature](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/South_Latitude_Vs_Temperature.png)

The following image displays the southern latitude versus temperature with a red line across its data points. The red line represents the regression and predicts information placements if other information was added. As the latitude decreases, the hotter the temperature it is. It has the opposite effect of the northern hemisphere.  

#### S. Latitude vs Humidity
![Southern Latitude vs Humidity](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/South_Latitude_Vs_Humidity.png)

The following image displays the southern latitude versus humidity with a red line across its data points. The red line represents the regression and predicts information placements if other information was added.  

#### S. Latitude vs Cloudiness
![Southern Latitude vs Cloudiness](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Weather_Search/blob/main/Images/South_Latitude_Vs_Cloudiness.png)

The following image displays the southern latitude versus cloudiness with a red line across its data points. The red line represents the regression and predicts information placements if other information was added. The regression is positive and its data is all over the place. In the soutern and nothern hemisphere, cloudiness does not play a factor when it depends on the latitude.
